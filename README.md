# ghostscript4js
Ghostscript4JS binds the Ghostscript C API to bring Ghostscript power to the Node.JS world.

### This project is not yet finished give me another time :-)

## Note

To build, and run the module, you must have ``libgs-dev`` installed.

On Debian systems, this can be achieved using ``apt-get install libgs-dev``.
